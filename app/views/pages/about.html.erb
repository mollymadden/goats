<p class="paragraph">Jim's Goats have been serving Melbourne since 2007, when we first saw an opportunity to utilise Goats, one of the cutest and most versatile animals in Australia. With an increasing population in inner city suburbs, garage ownership and storage solutions are harder to come by. There is also the pesky problem of noise pollution; how does a renter in Fitzroy maintain their garden patch whilst keeping their neighbours happy when they cannot afford a lawnmower nor store it? Simple! Rent a goat!</p>

Goat safety is paramount above all else. Please see below details based on skill category.
